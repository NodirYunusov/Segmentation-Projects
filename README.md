### Flood Area Segmentation
This project focuses on the segmentation of flood-affected areas in satellite imagery using deep learning techniques. By training a segmentation model, the project aims to automate the process of detecting and delineating flood zones from aerial images, which is essential for disaster management and emergency response.

The model achieves a Training Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.867, demonstrating high accuracy in identifying flood regions. Additionally, the model's best performance is characterized by a loss value of 0.266, indicating a strong fit to the data.

The Flood Area Segmentation project provides a valuable tool for early flood detection, facilitating quicker responses to mitigate the impact of floods and assisting in recovery efforts.

# Insect Segmentation using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on **semantic segmentation of insects** using deep learning. The model has been trained to accurately segment insects from various backgrounds, achieving high performance on both training and validation datasets.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images containing insects with corresponding ground truth masks. It includes diverse insect species in different environmental conditions to improve generalization.

## Model Architecture
- **Backbone:** [Specify the backbone, e.g., U-Net, DeepLabV3+, etc.]
- **Framework:** [Specify if TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another deep learning framework was used]
- **Loss Function:** [Specify the loss function, e.g., Cross-Entropy, Dice Loss, etc.]
- **Optimizer:** [Specify the optimizer, e.g., Adam, SGD]

## Performance Metrics
| Metric              | Training  | Validation |
|---------------------|----------|------------|
| IoU (Intersection over Union) | 0.90 | 0.85 |
| Pixel Accuracy | 0.98 | 0.96 |
| Loss | 0.028 | 0.084 |

## Training Details
- **Batch Size:** [Specify the batch size]
- **Number of Epochs:** [Specify the number of epochs]
- **Learning Rate:** [Specify the learning rate and scheduler if used]
- **Hardware Used:** [Specify GPU/CPU used for training]

## Usage
To perform inference on new images, run:
```bash
python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg --model_path path/to/model.pth
```

## Results
Below are sample predictions from the model:
